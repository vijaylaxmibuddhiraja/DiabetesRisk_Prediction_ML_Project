## Problem Statement

The objective is to build a predictive model for diagnosing diabetes based on health and lifestyle indicators.

## Problem Type
  Supervised Binary Classification

## Project Objective
1. **Dataset Acquisition & Description:** Obtain and describe the dataset.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Investigate data quality, distributions, and relationships.
3. **Problem Framing:** Define the machine learning task and preprocessing plan.

## Dataset
*   **Name:** Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset (Balanced 50/50 Split)
*   **Source:** Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2015, curated on Kaggle.
*   **Direct URL:** [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/diabetes-health-indicators-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/diabetes-health-indicators-dataset) (File: `diabetes_binary_5050split_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv`)
*   **Key Characteristics:** 70,692 instances, 21 features, binary target (`Diabetes_binary`), **artificially balanced classes**
